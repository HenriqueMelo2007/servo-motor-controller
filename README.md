# Servo Motor Controller

![Project Preview](assets/preview.png)

## Project Description

This Arduino project uses a button to control a 180-degree servo motor. Each time the button is pressed, the servo moves in 45-degree increments. Starting from 0 degrees, the motor moves to 45, 90, 135, and finally 180 degrees. When the button is pressed after reaching 180 degrees, the servo resets to 0 degrees and the cycle repeats. The project involves using the Arduino to read the button input and control the servo motor based on the number of presses.

## Components

- Arduino Uno
- Positional micro servo
- Button
- Resistor
